## Introduction

Diabetes is a prevalent and complex chronic condition.  This project aims to provide a robust framework for predicting diabetes by integrating linear algebra and machine learning. The provided dataset (`diabetes.csv`) contains diverse patient features, including demographic details and symptoms.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the `diabetes.csv` dataset, containing patient information relevant to diabetes prediction.  The features include:

* **Age:** Patient age
* **Gender:** Patient gender
* **Polyuria:** Excessive urination indicator
* **Polydipsia:** Excessive thirst indicator
* **Sudden Weight Loss:** Rapid weight loss occurrence
* **Weakness:** Presence of weakness
* **Polyphagia:** Excessive hunger indicator
* **Genital Thrush:** Presence of genital thrush
* **Visual Blurring:** Visual blurring indicator
* **Itching:** Presence of itching
* **Irritability:** Indication of irritability
* **Delayed Healing:** Delayed wound healing
* **Partial Paresis:** Partial paralysis indicator
* **Muscle Stiffness:** Muscle stiffness indication
* **Alopecia:** Presence of alopecia (hair loss)
* **Obesity:** Obesity indicator
* **Class:** Target variable denoting diabetes status (Positive or Negative)


## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Data exploration and missing values check
    * Class distribution analysis
    * Data type conversion (categorical to numerical)
    * Data type verification

2. **Feature Selection:**
    * Correlation analysis
    * Chi-squared and f_classif scores
    * Feature selection and integration

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    * **Random Forest Classifier:** Training, performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), confusion matrix visualization, decision tree visualization.
    * **Gradient Boosting Classifier:** Training, performance evaluation, confusion matrix visualization, decision tree visualization.
    * **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA):** Training, performance evaluation, confusion matrix visualization.

## Results

The results section presents the performance metrics, confusion matrices, and decision tree visualizations for each model. A comparative analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.  (Refer to the original document for detailed results and figures).

## Discussion

The discussion elaborates on the findings, including the impact of feature selection on model performance and the nuanced differences in predictive capabilities across models.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the successful integration of linear algebra for enhanced diabetes prediction.  It serves as a foundation for future work, including ensemble models, hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and interpretability enhancements.
